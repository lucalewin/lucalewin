# About me

Hi, my name is Luca and I've been programming since I was 12 years old.
I started with Java because I wanted to develop custom plugins for my Minecraft server.
I learned C by trying to write a compiler for [my own programming language](https://github.com/lucr4ft/luvascript-compiler). For that I also had to learn x86-assembly. But then I noticed that the language I was creating looked similar to Rust. Because of that I started to learn Rust which is right now my language of choice for new projects.
