## About me
Hi, my name is Luca and I've been programming since I was 12 years old.
I started with Java because I wanted to develop custom plugins for my Minecraft server.
I mostly taught myself Java, as well as JavaScript, Python and Kotlin.
Right now I'm learning C by trying to code a compiler for my own programming language ([luvascript-compiler](https://github.com/lucr4ft/luvascript-compiler)).

### My projects

Most of my projects are hosted in my own organization [lucr4ft](https://github.com/lucr4ft) on Github and some on my own Github page.

You can find a list of all my projects [here](./projects.md)

### Programming languages I use
- Java (and Kotlin)
- C#
- Javascript
- Python
- C / C++

### Contact
At the moment you can only reach me via my [Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/__lucraft).
I am currently working on other ways to contact me.
