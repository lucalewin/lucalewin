## About me
Hi, my name is Luca and I've been programming since I was 12 years old.
I started with Java because I wanted to develop custom plugins for my Minecraft server.
I mostly taught myself Java, as well as JavaScript, Python and Kotlin.
Right now I'm learning C by trying to code a compiler for my own programming language.
